Practise machine learning with the [Kaggle Titanic problem](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

This is a replica of [Megan Risdal's post, Exploring Survival on the Titanic
](https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/exploring-survival-on-the-titanic).

I changed a bit in the codes with more [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) style to make them clearer.

See [Kaggle-Titanic.Rmd](Kaggle-Titanic.Rmd) for codes and explanations.  
[Kaggle-Titanic.nb.html](Kaggle-Titanic.nb.html) is supposed to show codes, explanations, and code outputs together on a webpage. 
However this file is too big to display on GitHub.
